# bqsync
A utility for synchronising big query datasets between regions.
Note in a copy assumption is that all source projects and datasets are in 1 region and all destination projects and 
datasets are also in the same region. The source region and destination region MAY be different.
 
basic usage is as follows
 
    bqsync --[no]version --src_project_datasets=[project1.dataset1,project1.dataset2,project2.dataset3] \
    --dst_project_datasset=[project1.dataset4,project2.dataset5,project3.dataset6] \
    --src_ref_project_datasets=[project1.dataset6,project1.dataset7] \
    --dst_ref_project_datasets=[project1.dataset8,project2.dataset9] \
    --src_bucket=bucket_name --dst_bucket=another_bucket_name \
    --copy_data=True \
    --copy_types=TABLE,VIEW,ROUTINES,MATERIALIZEDVIEW \
    --remove_deleted_tables=True \
    --check_depth=-1 \
    --table_or_views_to_copy=.* \
    --table_or_views_to_exclude= \
    --days_before_latest_day=10 \
    --latest_date=2019-12-30 \
    --do_day_partition_deep_check=True \
    --analysis_project=project3 \
    --query_cmek=None \
    --src_policy_tags= \
    --dst_policy_tags=
 
Arguments

*version* - bqsync will print version it is 
*src_project_datasets* - A comma separated list of projects and datasets to copy to the destination
projects and datasets. Each item in list is project followed by a period '.' and then the dataset.
The list in this argument **MUST** contain same number as in the *dst_project_dataset* argument.

*dst_project_datasets* - A comma separated list of projects and datasets to copy into. These maybe
in a different region if they are then the *src_bucket* and *dst_bucket* **MUST** be specified.

*src_ref_project_datasets* - A comma separated list of projects and datasets that are referenced that still need 
remapping in view and access control (only relevant if copying views and access)

*dst_ref_project_datasets* - A comma separated list of projects and datasets to map src_ref_project_datasets to.

*src_bucket* - If the source set of datasets and region are different to the destination datasets
region data will be extracted from source dataset into this bucket meaning it **MUST** be in the
same region as the source datasets when copying across regions.
 
*dst_bucket* - if the destination set is different to the source the data extracted into src_bucket
will rewritten to this destination bucket and then loaded into the destination datasets. It **MUST**
match the region of the target datasets.
 
*copy_data* - Default is True bqsync will copy data if set to False will only copy schemas
 
*copy_types* - Default is TABLE,VIEW,ROUTINE,MATERIALIZEDVIEW bqsync will attempt to adjust views/routines/materialized views  (i.e. change projects and dataset
names in the views/models,routines) such they work in the new region. If views cannot be created it will skip the view/model/routine
and move to the next logging an error. If item is not in list those objects are skipped
 
*remove_deleted_tables* - defaults to True removes tables/views in destination datset that do not exist
in source dataset

*check_depth* - defaults to -1. Sets amount of data checking non partitioned tables only use update time and row count.
Day partioned -2 can do rows per pratition -1 or rows per partition plus avg and stdev of farmfingerprint hash of fields
such as created time, update time, modified time, 0 does all level 0 fields hashs and std dev, 1 will do depth 1 adding 
depth effectively trades accuracy for timeliness  

*table_or_views_to_copy* - defaults to [".*"]. This is comma seperated list of regular expressions table and view names are 
compared against only if there is 1 match is the table or view copied.

*table_or_views_to_exclude* - default to [] empty list. This is comma seperated list of names to match tables or views 
against if any n the list  match the table/view name are excluded from the copy.

*days_before_latest_day* - defaults to None which is examine all day partitions. If set takes this number of days from
lates_date. This lets you reduce the rows checked. Combining check_depth and this setting let you trade off performance
against cost

*latest_date* - defaults to None which means todays date. Expects a parsable date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Sets upper limit
 of days to compare for day partition tables
 
*do_day_partition_deep_check* - Default False by default. Table bytes and last modification time are normally checked checked only if bytes differ or the
source table modification time  is after the destinations modification time is a deeper check done. This forces if True to do deep checks on all day 
partitioned tables even if these indicate no data changes have occured.

*analysis_project* - Default is None meaning the destination project is used for all query costs. If you need query 
charges to be the source or another project set this argument to the project to be charged.

*query_cmek* - Default is empty list. This parameter defines the CMEK key touse for the queries bqsync runs. If 
not specified bqsync attempts to auto detect by using the source datasets CMEK key and destination 
datasets default CMEK key.

*src_policy_tags* - A comma separated list of source policy tags this is used with the dst_policy_tags argument to map
policy tags across regions the first source policy tag maps to the first destination policy tags and so on. The src_policy_tags
and dst_policy_tags MUST be the same length. If no mapping is provided policy tags are stripped.

*dst_policy_tags* - A comma separated list of destination policy tags this is used with the src_policy_tags argument to map
policy tags across regions the first source policy tag maps to the first destination policy tags and so on. The src_policy_tags
and dst_policy_tags MUST be the same length. If no mapping is provided policy tags are stripped.
 
bqsync attempts to optimise synchronisation by comparing row numbers, bytes and last modified times for non
partitioned tables. 
For partitioned tables it compares each partition (row numbers, andaverage hash snd stdev hash (farm_fingerprint)
column(s) who lowercase with regexp search (does not need to be at start) matching  (modifi.\*time,
update.\*time, creat\*time) so fields like lastModifiedtime or lastUpdatedTime or modificationTime would all match
these) in both locations, only partitions with a mismatch are copied otherwise skipped. It copies within big query 
if source and destination regions are identical.
 
bqsync relies on application default credentials and boto files for configuration (for proxy etc).
 
As such it requires sufficient permissions to run it requires the ability to run queries in both source
and destination projects, ability to create and delete and list objects in src and destination buckets and
ability to create tables and views in destination datasets.
 
bqsync is resumable i.e. it will pick up where it left off tables schemas are copied first alphabetically
and there data asynchronously (largest row sets are prioritised) then views all table copying is completed
on first pair and only when first pair is complete does it move to the next. It is assumed bqsync will be rerun to 
resolve issue, bqsync will update tables and schemas for schema changes (assumes additions) it will also handle
non backward compatible in many cases by deleting recreataing tables and recopying data.
 
Unlike [dataset copying](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/copying-datasets) this tools has support for CMEK keys 
in source and destination it does this in 2 major ways;

* If the source table is encrypted with a global key the key is simply reused in the destination location.
* If the source table has a regional key say HSM key then it encrypts the new table with a key of exactly

the same name with location changed to the new location. That means for thise to work the target
key **MUST** exist in the location with exactly matching name. Plus be accesible to destination projects
service account.
 
Unlike dataset copying this also puts no constraint on number of tables more tables the longer it takes.
But as resumable can be restarted at anytime.
 
NB Tested in Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 and with bigquery libraries from 0.32.0 to 1.23.1 not all features
are supported in older libraries such as clustering etc. Testing has also avoided those so far. If you
are interested in testing and improving and contributing ideas raise issues on the project or take a fork 
and propose pull requests.
 
As failures can occur it is best to make sure a lifecycle rule of delete after 1 day is set on the
buckets for usage.
 
A json file like below can be used (say this was lifeCycle.json);
 
    {
      "lifecycle": {
        "rule": [
          {
            "action": {
              "type": "Delete"
            },
            "condition": {
              "age": 1,
              "isLive": true
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
 
The following command would set the life cycle on the bucket
 
    gsutil lifecycle set lifeCycle.json url
    
It is also worth noting bqsync for reasonable datasets when used is highly likely to hit quota limits notable extract 
bytes per day (as of writing 11 terabytes a day). It may also hit max quotas and load/extracts per table and copies per 
table.
